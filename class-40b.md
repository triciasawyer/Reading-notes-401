If there are no questions provided, summarize and explain this topic via an analogy from your previous work or home experience.


In the daycare I previously worked at, part of my job was being responsible for creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for children. I facilitated activities and provided support to help them learn and grow. Similarly, in the open-source community, I can think of myself as a mentor or facilitator for newcomers who want to make their first contribution. Although, I am navigating my way still. But just as I guided children through various activities, I can relate that to guiding new contributors through the process of making their first open-source contribution. I can help them understand the codebase, provide resources and guidance, and offer encouragement and support along the way, especially given my experience through code school and the high pressure, fast paces environment that I endured while learning.
