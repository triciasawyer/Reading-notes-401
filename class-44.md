## Written response

After reading the article [Amazon workers demand Jeff Bezos cancel "Recognition” software](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-workers-demand-jeff-bezos-cancel-face-recognitio-1827037509), I was really taken back by what had happened and it wasn't something that I heard about before reading this. The article highlights the ethical concerns raised by Amazon employees regarding the company's involvement in providing facial recognition technology and cloud services to law enforcement agencies. The employees express their belief that such technologies can be misused and pose a threat to the civil rights, particularly in the context of the Trump administration's immigration policies. The workers emphasize the importance of taking responsibility for the impact of their work, and comparing the similarities to historical events where technology was used in ways that violated human rights. The employees demand a choice in what they build and a say in how it is used, and they all just want transparency, accountability, and a refusal to support oppressive practices. I think the content that this article holds speaks volumes and sparks the minds of other works within the tech field. I think, and hope, we all want to follow our ethics and morals as a society and push technology in the right direction, especially since that has been a big topic of discussion the past decade. This article was overall insightful and interesting, and I think we all should stand up for what we believe is right, especially as we are all ultimately working together in pushing technology forward.

I also read the article [Ethical dilemma of self driving cars](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/technology/the-ethical-dilemmas-of-self-drivingcars/article37803470/), and the topic this article discusses is something I never thought about until now, so I was really pleased with reading this one. The article discusses the ethical dilemmas surrounding self-driving cars and the challenging decisions they may face in unavoidable accidents. It raises questions about who should be prioritized for safety in such situations and discusses the need to program AI to make split-second moral choices. I personally believe that self driving cars are awesome and a big step within technology and society, but I also understand that this ethical dilemma is real and is a huge topic that should be discussed. I think if I knew my car had those features as a machine, to be able to make split-second decisions on its own on who to save in such a situation, I wouldn't want it. That is a little scary, to think I would trust my car itself to that extent, and I would rather have it be my fault and my decision than my cars. How would that affect the law if someone did get hurt? Would the car be the one blamed? Would it divide society even more with such situations? This topic raised so many questions in my mind and made me want to read more!
