# Reading notes class 35 - Graphs

## Teach something that you learned from the readings listed below

Some ideas for how you might want to teach:

- Use an analogy
- Explain a detail in depth
- Use WHY, WHAT, HOW structure
- utorial / walk through an example
- Write a quiz
- Create a vocabulary/definition list
- Write a cheat sheet
- Create a diagram / visualization / cartoon of a topic
- Anthropomorphize the concepts, and write a conversation between them
- Build a map of the information
- Construct a fill-in-the-blank worksheet for the topic

I chose to use an analogy to explain graphs based on the content provided in the article noted above.

Graphs can be compared to a navigation system for a road trip, where vertices(cities, towns) represent destinations, and edges represent routes. There are different types of graphs, such as undirected graphs (two-way roads) and directed graphs (one-way roads). Complete graphs have direct connections between all destinations, while connected graphs allow access to all destinations. Disconnected graphs have isolated destinations without direct connections. Acyclic graphs have no loops, while cyclic graphs have circular routes. Weighted graphs assign values to routes, similar to roads with specific distances or costs. Traversing a graph is like navigating through destinations, with breadth-first traversal exploring nearby locations first and depth-first traversal diving deep into one route before backtracking. Understanding graphs helps analyze complex data structures in fields like transportation and social network.
