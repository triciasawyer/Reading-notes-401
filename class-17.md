## AWS Lambda Basics

**What is AWS Lambda?**
A serverless computing service within AWS. It allows you to run your code without provisioning or managing servers. You can focus on writing your code while AWS handles the infrastructure and scaling aspects.

**Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.**
Scalable APIs and data processing

**Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.**
Say you want to run a small business, like selling sculpted pieces online. Normally, you would need to rent a physical store, buy display shelves, hire staff, and manage everything yourself. You would have to worry about paying for rent, electricity, and maintaining the store at all times. Now with the serverless concept, it allows you to focus on your core business activities without the need to manage and maintain the technical infrastructure. You could think of it as like renting a store space where you don't have to worry about all the tasks behind the scenes, and you only pay when you actually make sales.
