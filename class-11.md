# Reading notes class 11

## Event driven programming

**What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?**
The "events" module, which provides an EventEmitter class that serves as the foundation for building event-driven applications in Node.js.

**What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?**
By combining the principles and benefits of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with vent Driven Programming (EDP), developers can build more modular, reusable, and maintainable event-driven applications. OOP provides a structured approach to organizing code, encapsulating functionality, and managing state, while EDP enables responsiveness to asynchronous events and promotes loose coupling between components.

**Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.**
Imagine you have a website or application that needs to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, like responding to user requests, processing data, and communicating with a database. Event Driven Programming (EDP) with Node.js is helpful in managing all of these tasks. It does this by leveraging JavaScript's ability to work asynchronously, meaning it can perform multiple operations concurrently without waiting for each one to complete. So, when a user sends a request, such as submitting a form or clicking a button, Node.js can quickly handle it and continue processing other requests simultaneously. It does this by using events and event handlers.

## Additional Questions

**Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?**
I am looking forward to tree implementations and just learning more about that..

**What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**
To learn about the Event driven architecture to expand my knowledge in regards to events.
