# Reading notes class 29 - Hash Tables

## Teach something that you learned from the readings listed below

Some ideas for how you might want to teach:

- Use an analogy
- Explain a detail in depth
- Use WHY, WHAT, HOW structure
- utorial / walk through an example
- Write a quiz
- Create a vocabulary/definition list
- Write a cheat sheet
- Create a diagram / visualization / cartoon of a topic
- Anthropomorphize the concepts, and write a conversation between them
- Build a map of the information
- Construct a fill-in-the-blank worksheet for the topic
