# Reading notes class 9

## [Read today’s lab requirements](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/6745251/discussion_topics/18080718)

Note: Requirement is to spend one lab session working on this project, however additional time may be an option. Due date will be given in class and we’ll present briefly at the beginning of the next module.

**Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.**

Social media platform where users can create posts, follow other users, and interact with their content. The API server will handle user authentication, manage user profiles and posts in a database, and implement access control to ensure users can only interact with authorized resources.

Another possible project idea is to create a blogging platform where users can write and publish blog posts. Users can register, login, and manage their own blog posts. The application will utilize an API server for authentication, perform database operations for storing blog posts and user information, and employ access control to ensure only authorized users can create and manage their own blog posts. Possibly could get this done in the alloted time but not sure.

## Reflection

**What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**

Working more with Auth, as I’ve briefly worked with Auth in my code 301 presentation but would like to get more comfortable with that.
