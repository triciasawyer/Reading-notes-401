## Prep: Practice in the terminal

After reading the articles about the bash command line and how the terminal works, I better understand the simplicity of the commands, like if you want to make a directory, you say mkdir, or when moving a directory, you say mvdir. I definitely like the terminal now that I understand it, but at first, I was very hesitant and a bit scared to just mess around with it because I didn't want to mess anything up. I think this topic is important because the terminal is very useful and it's something that I believe everyone should know how to work with.

## Prep: The Growth Mindset

This topic matters because as we are working on things that can have many issues or bring on frustration, we need to understand and know how to deal with those things, as well as just putting ourselves in a good head space to begin with, to be able to better solve problems and code overall. I can relate this to my previous work experience, as I worked at an Early Childcare Center (ECC) before attending DeltaV. Working in a daycare environment can easily break you if you aren't prepared or equipped to deal with many of the things that you deal with daily. I was an assistant teacher who floated to different rooms through out the day so that made it more difficult, but I had to have that growth mindset of embracing challenges and changes, and putting in effort with each child because I know that was going to lead to results for myself and the children. If I didn't have that growth mindset, I would be bulldozed by the children and caught off guard with challenges or changes. The children depended on someone like me at that time, and that was very important to be able to be there for them and support them, and even when it was chaos at times, I had to be able to manage myself for them.

## Prep: Introduction to SQL

To summarize my understanding of relational databases and SQL, relational databases provide several advantages including data integrity through the use of constraints and relationships, scalability, and ease of data manipulation through SQL queries. They are widely used in multiple industries and applications to store and retrieve structured data.

## Prep: Data Structures and Algorithms

**What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?**
What are the operations going to perform and how often they are going to be executed. Keep in mind that there are several ways of executing something.

**How can we ensure that we’ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?**
You need at least one branch (with an if/else statement) that does not make a recursive call. Branches without recursive calls are called base cases, and branches with recursive calls are called recursive cases.

## Prep: Engineering Readings

**What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?**
One thing I bring to this career, and a potential employer, that nobody else can is my experiences. I say that because my expereinces are unique to me. For example, I was invovled in many team sports and I just graduated college, which has made me a good collaborator so working with others goes pretty well. I also can draw experience from my past jobs, such as a statistic keeper for Perfect Game baseball where I grew in my ability to be aware and detailed in what I did, whichh can transate over to my work in code.

**What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?**
Google an example to get a refresher, take a 5-10 minute break to then come back and have a fresh set of eyes, and ask for help (15 minute rule!)

### Things I want to know more about

<u>Practice in the Terminal:</u> I want to know more about the commands and be able to just know them by heart to be able to use them confidently.

<u>The Growth Mindset:</u> I want to know more about being able to grow mentally so I can better myself whether that be for work or just growing as a person in general. Confidence is a big one that I want to grow in.

<u>Introduction to SQL:</u> I want to know more about how to control it and all the selectors that can be used to do certain things.

<u>Data Structures and Algorithms:</u> I want to know more about recursive call stacks, and knowing which data structure to use when.
