# Reading notes class 14

## [Read today’s Lab Requirements](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-14/lab/)

Note: Requirement is to spend one lab session working on this project, however additional time may be an option. Due date will be given in class and we’ll present briefly at the beginning of the next module.

**Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.**

A chat application that enables users to join communities of their interest and engage in real-time discussions. Users would be able to explore different communities, join chat rooms, share thoughts, and connect with like-minded individuals. I think if I were to actually create something like this, it would be cool to add a locations API as well.

A collaborative whiteboard application where multiple clients can connect to the server and collaborate in real-time. Clients would be able to publish their drawing actions to the hub, and the hub will distribute the actions to other clients for synchronized display.

## Reflection

**What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**

I am hoping to achieve whatever project idea my partner and I choose, that will include an event based messaging server, which I am eager to learn more about and create myself!
