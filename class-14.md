# Reading notes class 14

## Read today’s Lab Requirements

Note: Requirement is to spend one lab session working on this project, however additional time may be an option. Due date will be given in class and we’ll present briefly at the beginning of the next module.

**Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.**
A real-time chat application where the hub server acts as a central messaging hub, and multiple clients can connect to it to exchange messages. Clients can publish messages to the hub, which will then distribute the messages to other connected clients based on their subscriptions. This project will involve implementing a server-client architecture, event-driven communication, and handling message publishing and subscription.

Build a collaborative whiteboard application where multiple clients can connect to the hub server and collaborate in real-time. Clients can publish their drawing actions (such as drawing lines, shapes, or annotations) to the hub, and the hub will distribute the actions to other clients for synchronized display. It will involve establishing a networked communication infrastructure, managing collaborative sessions, and implementing event-based synchronization.

## Reflection

**What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**
I am hoping to achieve whatever project idea my partner and I choose, that will include an event based messaging server, which I am eager to learn more about and create myself!
