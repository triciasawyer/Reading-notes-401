# Reading notes class 9 - Stacks and Queues

## Teach something that you learned from the readings listed below

Some ideas for how you might want to teach:

- Use an analogy
- Explain a detail in depth
- Use WHY, WHAT, HOW structure
- utorial / walk through an example
- Write a quiz
- Create a vocabulary/definition list
- Write a cheat sheet
- Create a diagram / visualization / cartoon of a topic
- Anthropomorphize the concepts, and write a conversation between them
- Build a map of the information
- Construct a fill-in-the-blank worksheet for the topic

1. What is a stack?

A stack is a data structure that follows the __________(First In Last Out) or__________ (Last In First Out) principle. It consists of nodes, and each node references the __________ node in the stack.

2. Pushing a node onto a stack is an __________ operation (think of the BigO time complexity).

3. Popping a node off a stack is also an __________ operation.

4. When you peek at a stack, you view the value of the __________ node.

5. The isEmpty operation in a stack has a time complexity of __________.

6. What is a queue?

A queue is a data structure that follows the __________(First In First Out) or__________ (Last In Last Out) principle. It has two important nodes: the __________node and the__________ node.

7. Enqueueing an item to a queue is an __________ operation.

8. Dequeueing an item from a queue is also an __________ operation.

9. When you peek at a queue, you view the value of the __________ node.

10. The isEmpty operation in a queue has a time complexity of __________.
