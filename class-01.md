# Reading notes class 1

## Review if helpful: An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

**How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?**
Node is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. Node is used for server-side programming, so developers can use the JavaScript programming language for both, client-side and server-side code.

**What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?**
Node is a JavaScript runtime, meaning that it is a software stack responsible for installing your web service's code and its dependencies, and running the service.

**What is Node used for?**
Node allows developers to write JavaScript code in the computer process itself instead of in a browser. So, Node can be used to write server-side (backend) applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else that's required to build fully-functional applications.
