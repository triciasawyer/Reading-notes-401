# Reading notes class 1

## Review if helpful: An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

**How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?**
Node is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. Node is used for server-side programming, so developers can use the JavaScript programming language for both, client-side and server-side code.

**What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?**
Node is a JavaScript runtime, meaning that it is a software stack responsible for installing your web service's code and its dependencies, and running the service.

**What is Node used for?**
Node allows developers to write JavaScript code in the computer process itself instead of in a browser. So, Node can be used to write server-side (backend) applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else that's required to build fully-functional applications.

## Additional Questions

**Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?**
I am looking forward to learning about modules and testing, and hooks. Although, I am looking forward to learning overall in this course.

**What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**
My learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README are to just take each day at a time, and take in everything that is taught. I plan to take notes, review my reading notes for that day, and rewatch lecture videos if needed to help my learning. I hope to not only better my knowledge and grow in my learning, but also grow as a person, as I connect with and learn from new people.

## Things I want to know more about

I want to know more about how node works and the server-side in general, and just getting more comfortable with that over time with experience.
