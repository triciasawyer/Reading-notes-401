## AWS API Gateway Overview

**What is Amazon API Gateway?**
It is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API, and then connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

**Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless ecosystem?**
Within the Serverless ecosystem, API Gateway is the piece that ties together Serverless functions and API definitions. Being able to trigger the execution of a Serverless function directly in response to an HTTP request is why API Gateway is so valuable in Serverless setups. When using API Gateway together with other AWS services, itâ€™s possible to build a fully functional customer-facing web application without maintaining a single server yourself. That brings the advantages of scalability, low maintenance, and low cost.

**How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?**
Some AWS services that support integration with Amazon API Gateway are:

- AWS Lambda: run Lambda functions to generate HTTP API responses.
- AWS SNS: publish SNS notifications when an HTTP API endpoint is accessed.
- Amazon Cognito: provide authentication and authorization for your HTTP APIs.

API Gateway supports direct integrations that can be configured in the API Gateway user interface with the following actions such as:

- Invoking an AWS Lambda function.
- Invoking another HTTP endpoint, with or without VPC Link.
- Making an HTTP call against the API of any AWS service that provides an HTTP API.
- Returning a mock response generated within API Gateway without calling out to other services.
