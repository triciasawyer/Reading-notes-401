# Reading notes class 15 - Trees

## Teach something that you learned from the readings listed below

Some ideas for how you might want to teach:

- Use an analogy
- Explain a detail in depth
- Use WHY, WHAT, HOW structure
- utorial / walk through an example
- Write a quiz
- Create a vocabulary/definition list
- Write a cheat sheet
- Create a diagram / visualization / cartoon of a topic
- Anthropomorphize the concepts, and write a conversation between them
- Build a map of the information
- Construct a fill-in-the-blank worksheet for the topic

I chose to write an analogy to illustrate the differences between binary trees and K-ary trees.

Think of a binary tree as a library where each shelf can hold up to two books. It's like a classic library with narrow shelves that can accommodate two books side by side. On the other hand, a K-ary tree is more flexible. It allows each shelf to hold up to K books, where K can be any positive integer. So, you can have a library with wider shelves capable of storing more books.

To summarize, the difference between binary trees and K-ary trees is the number of elements each node can hold(or number of books each shelf can hold). Then, depth-first traversal explores the nodes in a left to right, to parent order, while breadth-first traversal visits the nodes level by level.
