## AWS EC2

**What is an EC2 Instance?**
An EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance is a virtual server provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is one of the fundamental building blocks of AWS's cloud computing services. EC2 instances allow users to rent virtual machines on which they can run applications and services.

**Name 2 use cases for EC2.**

- EC2 instances are often used to host web applications and websites. By launching EC2 instances, users can set up virtual servers to run their web application stacks, including web servers, application servers, and databases. They can choose the appropriate instance type and configure the resources based on the anticipated traffic and performance requirements of their application.
- EC2 instances are frequently utilized for big data processing and analytics tasks. Users can launch EC2 instances with ample CPU and memory resources to run distributed processing frameworks like Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark. These instances can process large volumes of data in parallel, perform complex analytics, and generate insights.

**Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com.**
One reason to use ECS (Elastic Container Service) instead of services like Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com is the flexibility and control it offers over your infrastructure. ECS allows you to have fine-grained control over the underlying infrastructure and the containerization of your applications. That is beneficial because you have the ability to customize and configure the underlying infrastructure to meet your specific requirements. You can define your own Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), customize networking settings, and configure auto-scaling rules. This level of control allows you to optimize the performance, security, and cost of your infrastructure based on your application's needs.
